Users can input their tasks and appointment into the alotted timeslots and save their schedule. In addition, users can easily track their task priorities given each slot is current-time responsive. Likewise, the app is always up to date with the current date for added scheduling ease.

## Usage
Upon opening the work scheduler webpage, users are presented with a title bar containing the current date. Below which, there is a table with distinct time slots corresponding with the hours of the day, as presented to the left of each slot. These reflect the hours of typical work day; 9AM - 5PM. User can type in each hour-slot and add their personal task/appointments for that time. Then by clicking the corresponding save button to the right of the slot, this information is saved. Upon doing so, users are notified that their task has been stored. When users reload the page, the previously saved tasks remain in the allotted time slot.
